*"Snorre sier at Ull kalles skiguden, bueguden, jaktguden og skjoldguden"*
# This project: Making an open source, 3D-printable, reconfigurable slingbow. 

I'll post my waypoints as I progress towards the target:

ull: Probably finished, though I haven't printed it yet. Standard slingshot, 3-hole BTF (Behind The Fork) tube attachment. 

ull_decorated: Same as above but decorated and with integral print support. 3-hole BTF tube attachment. Not printed yet.
