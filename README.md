*"Snorre sier at Ull kalles skiguden, bueguden, jaktguden og skjoldguden"*

# An open source, 3D-printable, reconfigurable slingbow. 

I'll post my waypoints as I progress towards the target:

---

## ull

Proof of concept. Standard slingshot, 3-hole BTF (Behind The Fork) tube attachment. 

---

## ull_v2

Same as above but decorated and with integral print support. 3-hole BTF tube attachment.
Test printed at 80% of full size, 1mm shell, 25% gradual infill. A number of issues were found and addressed.

---

## ull_v3 

Issues with v2 fixed. Some notes and suggestions for v4:
- If we wish to only do "thumb and brace" the handle can be 17mm shorter.
- Turn design upside down?
- Move holes or deeper fork?
- Writing on surface?

v3 probably usable but haven't printed it yet.
