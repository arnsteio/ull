# While a minimal test build to check structure only takes a few minutes, 
# a proper test build takes an hour, and is necessary for most visuals.
# And final builds take several hours. Hence, a build host apart from my 
# day-to-day machine is useful and that is what this script provides.
# 
# My build machine is a 4-core, 8MB Linux machine implememted on the 
# UH-IaaS Openstack instance. Its setup is documented under the docs 
# catalogue.
